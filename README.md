   # Introduction
     
  This is an assignment for the Advanced Smart Contracts . I have used contract upgradeability and signing and verification patterns.
     
   # Signing and verification
   
  The contract Transcript.sol handles the verification part. The signing part should be implemented off-chain with your own  private       key. To this use Signing.js for that.

   The consensus operations are optimized to work eifficiently, even thought the loops are being used.
   It is made sure that loops break as soon as the consensus is reached.
     
   # Refference
